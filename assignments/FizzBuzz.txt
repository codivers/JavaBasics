For numbers 1 through 100,

•If the number is divisible by 3, print “Fizz”

•If the number is divisible by 5, print “Buzz”

•If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”

•Otherwise, print the number

Create a new java class called fizzBuzz.
Create a main method just like the one we saw in class.
Using loops and system.out.println write the algorithm for the above ask.
Commit and push your code to github under your own account once you are finished.
